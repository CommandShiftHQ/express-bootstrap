# Using API 

This project is a boilerplate for Node.js/Express applications. It also comes included with Jest, and Supertest for end-to-end testing.

## Getting started

Ensure your Visual Studio Code application is up to date, and that you have the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and enabled.

Replace `your-folder-name` with the folder name you wish to create and run the below inside your root folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SanMasood/express-bootstrap.git your-folder-name
cd your-folder-name
npm install
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/] in your browser and you should see the webpage welcoming you. 
## Commands to use:
`http://localhost:3000/jokes` to display all jokes.
`http://localhost:3000/jokes/random` to see a random Chuck Norris joke.
`http://localhost:3000/jokes/random/personal/first/last` where `first` and `last` can be replaced with your choice of words to display a personalized random joke.
